Come Meet Your Lucky Dog or Cat at this Weekend's Events<br>
<font face = "Sans-Serif" size=2>
Hello, Pre-Approved Adopters!
<br><br>
The best way to meet multiple dogs is at Lucky Dog’s adoption events, which are held every Sunday and most Saturdays.  Sunday events generally are larger and can have as many as 50-70 dogs. Saturday events are generally smaller and are limited to 10 dogs.  We can always do adoptions on site at Sunday events, but our ability to do so on Saturdays depends on the number of volunteers signed up to help.  Please email Ashley (events@luckydoganimalrescue.org) if you have questions about this week’s events! 
<br><br>
When you attend an event, you will notice that every adoptable dog has on a bandanna.  We have a few different colors, which designate dogs whom are working on behavioral training with us. 
<br><br>
<b><span style="color:#6AA84F">GREEN</span></b> is the color for dogs that have no known behavioral issues.  <b><span style="color:red">RED</span></b> is the color we will use for ANY reactivity towards other dogs.  This means please give them a wide berth when you are with another dog at an event.  <b><span style="color:#ffd966">YELLOW</span></b> means caution when approaching at all -- these are dogs with "stranger danger" issues.   Please speak to the handler before approaching.
<br><br>
<b><u>Please note that this is a tentative list.  Dogs may be adopted before the events occur or conflicts may arise with fosters or volunteer drivers that prevent a dog's attendance.  If you have interest in a specific dog on this list, please let us know as soon as you can so we can keep you updated on that dog's status!</u></b>

More information about these wonderful dogs (and others!) can be found at <a href="http://www.luckydoganimalrescue.org">http://www.luckydoganimalrescue.org</a>! If you are interested in a Lucky Dog that is not attending this week’s events, please let us or your Adoptions Coordinator know so we can arrange a private meeting.
<br><br>
Please note - puppies under 5 months are not eligible for priorities - so we encourage you to ask about our Off Transport adoptions! If you want more info on any of these options, please reach out to us ASAP. 
<br><br>
Thank you for your interest in saving a life through Lucky Dog Animal Rescue, and we look forward to seeing you at an event soon!
