Hi $name -

Thank you so much for offering to drive some of our Lucky Dogs to the adoption event this $dayOfWeek, $date from 12-2pm at the $locationName (<a href="$locationLink">$locationAddress</a>).
<br><br>
<b><i>Please make sure the dog that you are given match the photo I've included below as we've had instances of dog mix ups in the past!  Please do not bring any dogs except the dog(s) listed. :)</i></b>

<b><i>Driving Instructions:</i></b>
<ul>
<li>If you are driving just <b>one dog</b>, please go park and bring the dog to check in.</li>
<li>If you are driving more than one dog, please call $ecName when you are close to the event ($ecPhoneNumber).  We will send an Adoption Coordinator to meet you to help you unload. If you'd like, you can keep one dog in your car, while the AC takes the other(s).  Then please go park and come back to the event and sign in.  <b>Our insurance prohibits any one person walking more than one dog.</b>  It is critical that we respect this important rule.</li>
<li><b>Please tie the dogs into the car during the trip.</b>  This will prevent the dogs from rough-housing with each other, climbing in your lap, or leaping out of the car when we try to unload.</li>

<li>Please plan to arrive at the event no later than 11:45 and plan to leave between 2:30 and 2:45.  We recommend scheduling about 15 minutes to load when you pick the dogs up.</li>
</ul>
Please call $ecName at <u>$ecPhoneNumber</u> if you have any issues picking up the dogs.
<br><br>
Again, thank you so much for offering to drive our pups!  We're so LUCKY to have great volunteers like you!
<br><br>
Thank you!
